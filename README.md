## This Repo Contains all the assignements when i was learning ML/AI from Nipun Batra's content

I am using Jupyter Notebooks to solve the assignments along with all explanations.
Then using Quarto to render the HTML files from this notebooks :)

- Using `uv` instead of `pip` because it is nice :)

Run this command in folder containing the notebook to render hmtl
```bash
quarto render Task1.ipynb
```
